# black_hat_python_3.X
Code from fantastic book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz, rewriten in python 3 with minor improvments.

Most of changes is focused on optimizing code, rewrite it with rules of PEP8, adding some minor improvments, like argument parsing,
which was not implemented in book. I am also removing 'bad' habbits(in my opinion) like global variabels and so on. But nonetheless book is
brilliant for learning about hacking and security.
